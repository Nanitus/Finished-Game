AI-this game has aspects that are similar to Undertale, the way that the player navigates and initiates battles are fairly similar and
battles last for a set amount of time rather than being beatable by the player

This is an improved version of the original file uploaded, originally I had problems with keeping the player where he was when the battle
is initiated but by using the PlayerPref float the X and Y positions of the player are updated when every battle is started and now
there is a winning condition to the game rather than being an infinite loop where the only outcome is to lose.
